### teacher notes

#### preparation

- print this outline
- https://scrimba.com/c/czq7kHe - create new / clean up!
- test scrimba features - follow from different browser, stop & play, catch up

#### outline

- check-in round: how are you? did you have time to revisit last class?
- what will we do today?

  testing out a new tool & format!

  Workshop:  Display   How Many Times  I  Clicked  The  Button         
  Communicating with the machine, Arrival style
  - For “How Many Times” - we need counting, numbers, maths, variables
  - For “Display” - we need alert, console.log, (dom changes)
  - For “Button” - we need the DOM, querySelector
  - For “Clicked” - we need functions, events, eventListener

##### What we have so far

- programming language vs markup language, control flow, variables, functions

##### “How many times”
- Numbers in the console
- the JavaScript console in the browser & in scrimba
- Adding stuff
- Other math operators
- Types - numbers and strings
- Adding numbers and strings
- Variables
- Adding variables
- Changing the value of a variable
- **Task**: pull up your console! what's 123 * 321?

##### “Display”
- The console vs a JavaScript file
- Console.log in a JavaScript file / scrimba js panel
- Alert
- **Task:** try it out! Alert a number, Log a number

##### “Button”
- Working with elements, HTML vs DOM
- $0 in the console
- QuerySelector, (querySelectorAll)
- Storing elements in variables
- **Task:** console.log some elements! Log a button, a header, an image

##### “Clicked”
- Only do stuff when x, not when I write them down
- Functions
- Wrap something in a function - it doesn’t run!
- Call a function
- Increment a value on every function call
- **Task:** Increment number of clicks and log it when I call a function
- addEventListener - call function only on click
- **Task:** call that function on a click! “Console.log number of clicks when I click on the button”
- **Task:** change stuff:
  - Console.log number of clicks when I click on the image
  - Alert number of clicks when I click on the image
  - Alert “you have clicked on the image {n} times” when I click on the image


- optional homework: look around at scrimba, test other screencasts
- check-out round: how are you? what was your key takeaway today? is there something you would change?
- feedback form incoming!
