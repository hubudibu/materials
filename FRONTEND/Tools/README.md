## Today's exercises

### Working locally

Create a folder on your computer for your course work & inside it create a folder for today's exercises.

Using the sample HTML structure below and [our work from the previous class](https://codepen.io/hubudibu/pen/bxvYNo?editors=1100), recreate last time's article locally in that folder.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Here goes everything -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Publishing to GitHub

Using GitHub Desktop, publish your work to GitHub. Enable GitHub Pages to see your work served.

### Workflow with GitHub Desktop

Do some changes on your article to get a hang of working with git. Remember to commit for every new thought.

### The Command Line

Explore the command line with [CodeCademy's command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line?locale_code=fr)

## Optional homework

Watch [these videos on how the internet works on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro#concept-intro)! Then go and explain it to someone!
