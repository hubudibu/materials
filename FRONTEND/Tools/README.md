## Today's exercises

### Working locally

Create a folder on your computer for your course work & inside it create a folder for today's exercises.

1. Create a website locally in that folder:
  - create a folder called `first` and in it a file called `first.html`, 
  - paste the sample HTML structure below in your new HTML file

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Our First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Here goes everything -->
    Everything!
  </body>
</html>
```

2. Recreate last time's article locally:
  - create the folder `second` and another HTML file in that folder called `article.html`,
  - copy [our work from the previous class](https://scrimba.com/c/c9BrVdh4) in there 
  - add an `index.css` file and its content from scrimba

### Publishing to GitHub

3. Try out GitHub Desktop with a [tutorial project](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

4. Using GitHub Desktop, publish your work from exercise 2 to GitHub. Enable GitHub Pages to see your work served.

Or start a free trial on CodeCademy to try out the [CodeCademy's command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line?locale_code=fr)

### Git from the Command Line
