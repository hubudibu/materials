### teacher notes

#### preparation

- print this outline
- create blank repo with desktop client for project work on class or clone last project work repo with desktop client
- check project work in editor, update editor, browser, etc if needed

#### outline

- check-in round: how are you? did you have time to revisit last class?
- what will we do today?

  review what we've learned so far   
  demo with no follow along   
  progress with project work

- workshop sections: review + CA + time for work
- 1 long CA, 1 hour tops, then free coding time
- take notes on board about steps during CA
- start reviewing homeworks when there are no questions

  - what new knowledge we can use: hover, rounded corners, breakpoints
  - hover for navigation
  - image corners, box corners
  - logo
  - find breakpoints
  - show-hide hamburger navigation
  - columns
  - change font size

- optional homework - none, more than enough from last class
- check-out round: how are you? what was your key takeaway today? is there something you would change?
