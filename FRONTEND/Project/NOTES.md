  - layout: wrap class, centering with margins or flexbox
  - talk about what we won't do (rounded corners, svg images, background images, input fields)
  - navigation with flexbox

  - "Intro" section with grid
  - "Offline" section with grid, code reuse 
  - "What you will learn" section using grid
