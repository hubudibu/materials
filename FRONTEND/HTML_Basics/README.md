## Today's exercise

Start a folder for today's exercises called `html_exercises`.   
Inside that, each exercise should go in its own folder, own repository and own HTML file. Each file should have a `<title>` tag with the exercise title.
Remember to commit often, add descriptive commit messages explaining `why` you did what you did!

The task is to break up the given content (on the left) into the appropriate HTML elements.
If you use the [given CSS file](assets/style.css), the result should look like the image on the right. Remember to copy the CSS file above into each of your exercise folders.

Each exercise goes like this:

1. create new folder
2. create new repository in it
3. add the CSS file, create your HTML file with a `<title>`
4. commit your initial files
5. start working on the exercise - copy content, pick elements
6. commit your work with a message focusing on *why* you did what you did
7. if it's not perfect for the first try, don't worry, try again - but make sure to commit each new try and each new thought, to learn from it later!
