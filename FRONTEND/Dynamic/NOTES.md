#### outline

- check-in round: how are you? did you have time to revisit last class?
- what will we do today?
- talk about:

  - **exercise** - Markdown
  - easier to edit, edit on github

  - jekyll - github pages, markdown
  - dynamic content - server sends index.html instead of /, applies theme, gets data
  - show: apply a theme to the teaching materials repo
  - **exercise**: theme chooser, check readme
    - new page
    - new style
    - new template

  - what's a template?
    - dynamic content - eg. blogposts

  - wordpress - wp.com, self-hosted
  - check their own wordpress theme repository, identify template tags, layouts
  - access to admin site?
 -  exercise - full setup? too much. live site? too risky. set up test site? w similar setup than live - what setup is that?

- optional homework
- check-out round: how are you? what was your key takeaway today? is there something you would change?
