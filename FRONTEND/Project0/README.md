## Today's PROJECT exercise

Let's get started with the class project!   
- Investigate the received design, plan basic sectioning structure for our HTML document.   
- Start a repository for your project work.
- Start with an `index.html` file.
- Remember to commit often, add descriptive commit messages explaining `why` you did what you did!
- Identify main content areas in the design, copy over content to your HTML document.
- Start sectioning your content with the proper HTML elements.
- Add a reset or normalize stylesheet as a foundation for your styles.
- Start adding descriptive classes to your elements.
- Start styling with basic text styles: font family, font sizes and colors. Make sure you reuse your styles and **avoid duplication**.
- Refine your document structure, continue adding contents and elements until ready.
- Push your work to your corresponding remote repository on GitHub.
- Set up GitHub Pages so you can see your work online.
